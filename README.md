Welcome to the Outlier Detection and Time Series Trend Analysis repository!

This repository provides an implementation of outlier detection and time series trend analysis methods using Python or Pyspark. In this repository, you will find details on how to implement these methods and determine whether a trend is stable or unstable.

The outlier detection section covers commonly used methods and demonstrates how to use Pyspark to detect significant changes in data. The time series trend analysis section explores the quantification of trends and how to determine their stability.

We also discuss the granularity level of the analysis, whether it is best to focus on the market or app level. Sample data from the Tableau public data sets is provided to demonstrate the application of these methods.

To get started, clone this repository and follow the instructions in the README file. We hope you find this repository helpful in your data analysis journey.
